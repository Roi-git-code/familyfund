               <p>
              The <strong>Family Fund</strong> is a community-based support system where members contribute 
              regularly to create a safety net for everyone. As a member, you enjoy financial support 
              during life events, access to emergency funds, and a network of committed individuals 
              who stand with you in both challenges and celebrations.
            </p>

            <p>
              Becoming a member starts with curiosity â€” learning about how we operate, our values, 
              and the benefits of being part of the Family Fund. If you believe in solidarity, mutual 
              responsibility, and financial empowerment, then this is the right place for you.
            </p>
